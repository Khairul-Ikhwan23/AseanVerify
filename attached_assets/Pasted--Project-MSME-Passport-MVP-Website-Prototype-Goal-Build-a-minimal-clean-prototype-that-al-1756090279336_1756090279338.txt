Project: MSME Passport MVP (Website Prototype)

Goal: Build a minimal, clean prototype that allows businesses to sign up, log in, complete their profile, and view a locked/unlocked “passport” (digital business card with QR).

Dashboard (after login)

   * Welcome banner: “Welcome, \[Business Name]”.
   * Passport card area:

       * Business name, logo placeholder, tagline.
